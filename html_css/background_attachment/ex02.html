  <p>In this example, we have created a fixed background image that will disappear slowly on scroll. Scroll the page to see the effect. <strong>Note:</strong> Try to remove the background-attachment property to really understand this example.</p>

  <div class="fixed-bg"></div>

  <div style="height:800px;background-color:yellow;">This div is only here to enable scrolling (height = 800 pixels).</div>
